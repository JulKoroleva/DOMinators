        'Okay, seriously, what the hell is going on with these servers? I’ve been kicked out of games like five times today, and it’s driving me crazy. It’s 2024, can we get some stable servers already? The game is awesome, but the lag is ruining it. If I see that damn “Connection Lost” screen one more time, I’m going to lose it.',

You can’t release an awesome game and then lock everything behind a paywall. Either give me everything for free or don’t waste my time. I’m not going to waste my money on this BS.',

I can’t even get a fair fight without getting stomped by some level 1000 guy who’s clearly been spending money on the game. It feels like they designed PvP just to piss us off.',
